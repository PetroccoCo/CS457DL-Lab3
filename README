Possible work breakdown as follows, for project 3:
Setup:
1. method to read the input from the user.
2. method to display usage of the resolver.
3. a resource record structure (RR.)
4. define different RR to use in the project (SIG, AAAA, and so on.)

Main Loop:
5. method to build a Query (query packet.)
6. method to execute the query (and get the response back.)
7. method to decode the response.
8. method to perform error handling, displaying appropriate messages depending on error.

Output and shutdown:
9. method to output the results.
10. a file or array with the list of servers available to query (DNS root servers.)

Error Checking Requirements (part 8):
  At each stage check the replies for the 3 error conditions Russ noted: 1) the hostname may not exist or 2) the hostname may exists, but no AAAA records are
  associated with the name, or 3) the AAAA records exists, but are not signed.
