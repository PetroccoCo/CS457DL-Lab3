Error Checking Requirements (part 8):
  At each stage check the replies for the 3 error conditions Russ noted: 1) the hostname may not exist or 2) the hostname may exists, but no AAAA records are
  associated with the name, or 3) the AAAA records exists, but are not signed.

Grading:
1. The program name should be "myresolver". if your program does not compile on the department linux machines using your makefile, or the file names are not correct. -50%
2. The print out message is incomplete or inaccurate. -20%
3. The user interface is incomplete. -10%
4. Test cases:
(1) www.iis.se: you should print out both the AAAA record and RRSIG record. 25%, if you print out any A record, -10%;
(2) www.nist.gov: you should print out both the AAAA and RRSIG record. 15%
(3) www.colostate.edu: you must look up and print out the CNAME if failure, 15%
(4) www.comcast6.net: you must look up and print out the CNAME if failure, 15%
